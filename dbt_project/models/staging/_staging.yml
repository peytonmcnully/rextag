# Staging models are added as new geodatabases are onboarded.
# Each follows the pattern:

# - name: stg_{source}_{layer}
#   description: "Cleaned {layer} data from {source} geodatabase"
#   columns:
#     - name: geom
#       description: "Geometry as GEOGRAPHY type"
#       tests:
#         - not_null
